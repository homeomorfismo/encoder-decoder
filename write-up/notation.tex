\section{Notation}

In this section, we summarize the notation used in this paper.

\subsection{Linear algebra and norms}

We denote all computational vectors and matrices with boldface letters; vectors are lowercase and matrices are uppercase.
% We assume we can reindex the elements of a vector or a matrix, so that we can describe them conveniently.


\subsection{Finite element theory}

Consider a domain \(\Omega \subset \mathbb{R}^d\) with boundary \(\partial \Omega\).
Consider \(\Gamma \subset \partial \Omega\) a subdomain of the boundary with positive measure.
We denote the standar Sobolev spaces with \(k\)th order derivatives by
\[
    H^k(\Omega) = \{ u \in L^2(\Omega) : \partial^\alpha u \in L^2(\Omega) \text{ for all } |\alpha| \leq k \},
\]
and the space of functions with zero trace on \(\Gamma\) by
\[
    \mathring{H}^k(\Omega)_\Gamma = \{ u \in H^k(\Omega) : u = 0 \text{ on } \Gamma \}.
\]
In particular, if \(\Gamma = \partial \Omega\), we write \(\mathring{H}^k(\Omega) = \mathring{H}^k(\Omega)_{\partial \Omega}\).
